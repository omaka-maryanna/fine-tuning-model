**this repo contains a fine-tuning model trained with lamini**

**what is fine-tuning**

fine tuning is a process in machine learning where a 
pretrain model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific 
dataset to inprove its performance for a particular application.

**dataset**

data was self generated and transform to json format
